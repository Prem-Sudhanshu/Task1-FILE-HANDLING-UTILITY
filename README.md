## The objective of Task 1 is to create a Java program capable of performing basic file operations, such as reading from, writing to, and modifying text files. This task helps interns understand Javaâ€™s file I/O (Input/Output) mechanisms and improves their hands-on skills in managing file-based data.

As part of this task, interns are expected to write a script that demonstrates key file-handling operations. The program should include functionalities like:

Reading contents from an existing file and displaying it.

Writing new content to a file (either by creating a new file or appending to an existing one).

Modifying specific data within a file, such as replacing a word or line.

The project should be developed using Java's standard libraries such as java.io.BufferedReader, java.io.FileWriter, and java.io.FileReader. Students are encouraged to follow clean coding practices, including proper commenting and logical code structure for readability and maintainability.

The deliverable for this task is a fully functional script with clear documentation and comments, stored in a GitHub repository. The task is foundational for any Java developer, reinforcing skills that are essential for dealing with file-based data, which is common in real-world applications such as log file processing, data configuration, and more.

This task also encourages the use of online learning resources like YouTube, Google, and ChatGPT to assist in understanding file handling and solving coding challenges. Completing this task successfully will contribute to receiving the completion certificate for the internship
